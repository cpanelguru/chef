Your customer is reporting that their PHP application is still not reflecting those changes after making php.ini changes into a custom php.ini file that they've placed in their site's public_html folder. You do a quick check on their environment details:

```
Kernel & Architecture: 2.6.32-642.13.1.el6.x86_64
 OS: CentOS release 6.8 (Final)
 cPanel Version: 11.68.0.23
 Apache: 2.4.16, listening on ports 80 & 443
 PHP: PHP 5.6.30 using DSO & mod_ruid2
 Uptime: 09:27:06 up 2 days
 Load Average: 0.07, 0.07, 0.02
 Disk Usage:
 / 75% utilized
 tmpfs 0% utilized
 /boot 34% utilized
```

- The customer should use a .htaccess file instead.

---

You've been making changes to your site's PHP-FPM configuration and to the available PHP extensions to improve security, and all of a sudden, your site stops working. You've made so many changes between the last check of your site and now that you aren't sure which change is causing the issue. You check the site's PHP error log and find the following:

```
[15-Aug-2022 18:51:17 UTC] PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function define() in /home/pandaham/public_html/index.php:14
```
Based on the above error, what can you reasonably conclude is causing the issue?

- The `define` function is included in the `disable_functions` setting.

---

What is the Apache configuration directive specifies the folder location from which a VirtualHost's static files are served?

- <Directory

---

You've found your next support ticket to work on, and the customer's site, coolsite.com, is displaying a "Forbidden" error message instead of the actual site content. Thinking about the troubleshooting process, you decide to start with Apache to rule out any issues. You're in luck! You see the following log entry when attempting to access the customer's site:

```
[Mon Aug 15 18:08:02.788211 2022] [core:crit] [pid 1244644] (13)Permission denied: [client 162.158.62.196:0] AH00529: /home/coolsite/public_html/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable and that '/home/coolsite/public_html/' is executable, referer: https://coolsite.com/
```

There is nothing wrong with the htaccess file's permissions or ownerships, yet the site still isn't loading correctly. You decide to check the full path leading up to htaccess file to rule out any other permission or ownership problems:

```
f: /home/coolsite/public_html/.htaccess
dr-xr-xr-x  root      root      /
drwx--x--x  root      root      home
drwx--x--x  coolsite  coolsite  coolsite
drw-rw-rw-  coolsite  coolsite  public_html
-rw-r--r--  coolsite  coolsite  .htaccess
```

Based on the above output, what can you reasonably conclude as the cause of the error?

- The documentroot's group needs to be changed to `nobody`.
